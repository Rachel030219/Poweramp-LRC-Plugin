    <string name="main_message">This is a simple app to make up for Poweramp\'s lack of local lyrics parser function. Before we start, some permissions are required to guarantee it works correctly.</string>
    <string name="main_old">Your Android version does not require any permission to be requested by the app, so nothing will get changed.</string>

    <string name="done_hint">All ready! Open Poweramp, start playing and enjoy!</string>
    <string name="done_extra">Note:\nWhen lyrics delay,  try pausing and resuming playing. By the way, delay caused by Poweramp may also be the cause, and Poweramp only reports position metered in second, thus when the lyrics go too fast or are at near the middle of a second (e.g. a lyric starting from 00:01.50) there will unavoidably exist delay. If you believe what you meet is a bug, please open a issue attached with procedures to reproduce the bug and delay caused by Poweramp on GitHub.</string>
