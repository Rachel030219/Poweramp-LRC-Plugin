    <string name="main_message">This is a simple app combining amazing libraries and APIs together to make up for Poweramp\'s lack of local lyrics parser function. After you press that button below, its icon will be hidden in launcher, and everything will be set up(below Android Q). When Poweramp starts to play, it automatically loads the corresponding .lrc lyric file.\n\nThis is still an alpha version, and of course contains a lot of bugs. If you\'ve met with any which is not found previously, please give it a 1-star review and open an issue on GitHub or write a critical comment on the Play Store page. Your opinion matters a lot.\n\n\nCredit:\nlrcview by wangchenyan\nPowerampAPI by Maksim Petrov\nAndroidX by Google</string>
    <string name="q_message">Please make sure that Poweramp\'s working directory is set to your internal storage root directory, otherwise this app won\'t work.This problem will get fixed in future updates.\n\n</string>
    <string name="main_hint">Please grant Poweramp LRC Plugin storage(read only) and floating window permission.</string>
