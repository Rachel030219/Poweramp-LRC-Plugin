    <string name="main_message">This is a simple app to fix Poweramp\'s lack of local LRC lyrics support. Before we start, some permissions are required to work correctly. \nAfter permissions are granted, a configuration page will appear.</string>

    <string name="done_hint">All ready! Open Poweramp, start playing, click the notification and enjoy!</string>
    <string name="done_extra">Note: \nWhen lyrics delay, try pausing and resuming playing. Delay caused by Poweramp may also be the cause, as Poweramp reports position in seconds, thus when the lyrics change too often or are at the middle of a second there will unavoidably exist delay. If you believe what you meet is a bug, please open a issue attached with procedures to reproduce the bug and delay caused by Poweramp on GitHub.</string>
